# #Question 1:
# Install Jupyter notebook and run the first program and share the screenshot of the output.
# 

# In[1]:


print("Hello world. welcome to Python")


# #Question 2:
# Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
# of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
# comma-separated sequence on a single line.
